# The Boredom Project: Battleship
`The Boredom Project: Battleship` is my recreation of the classic grid game Battleship. As of June 22, 2019, Battleship is likely to recieve updates.

### Disclaimer
These projects are BOREDOM inspired projects. So, depending on how bored I am, I may pump out several projects in a week. I might also be pre-occupied and not post a single project in several months (or years). So don't go expecting to see new stuff every month or even every day. Also, none of the projects here are subject to updates or bug fixes. I MAY fix bugs or add features, but don't count on it. OK, I'm done rambling. Check out my Boredom Projects, and for the love of something, use proper grammar.
