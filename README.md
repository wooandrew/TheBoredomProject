# The Boredom Project
The Boredom Project is just as the name suggests: a project, or a multitude of projects, born from boredom. Everything here is spontaneous, random, and probably small, unlike many of my other projects. In other words, it's the result of a 17-year-old without friends or a life.

### Disclaimer
These projects are BOREDOM inspired projects. So, depending on how bored I am, I may pump out several projects in a week. I might also be pre-occupied and not post a single project in several months (or years). So don't go expecting to see new stuff every month or even every day. Also, none of the projects here are subject to updates or bug fixes. I MAY fix bugs or add features, but don't count on it. OK, I'm done rambling. Check out my Boredom Projects, and for the love of something, use proper grammar.
